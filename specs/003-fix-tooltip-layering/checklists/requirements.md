# Specification Quality Checklist: 003-fix-tooltip-layering

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) *Note: Included architectural plan as explicitly requested by user.*
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders *(Includes technical sections per user request)*
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification *(Exception noted above)*

## Notes

- The user explicitly requested a "structured technical plan" including "architectural approach (portal usage)", "z-index management strategy", and "CSS best practices". These have been included under a specific "Technical & Architectural Requirements" section to fulfill the request, deviating slightly from the standard non-technical spec guidelines. The spec is complete and ready for the next phase.
