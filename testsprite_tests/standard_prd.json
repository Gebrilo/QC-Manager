  "product_overview": "QC Manager is a comprehensive Quality Control Management Tool designed to streamline project tracking, task management, resource allocation, and governance through integrated dashboards. It empowers QA and Test Leads to make data-driven decisions, enforce quality gates, and monitor project health seamlessly.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Provide real-time visibility into project quality metrics and task statuses.",
    "Enable standardized governance with configurable quality gates and release approval workflows.",
    "Support efficient resource allocation and workload monitoring.",
    "Deliver automated, rule-based insights and reporting capabilities.",
    "Ensure full auditability and traceability of all changes and approvals."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Project management with creation, updating, and soft deletion capabilities.",
    "Task management including detailed tracking, status transitions, and resource assignments.",
    "Resource pool management with utilization metrics and capacity monitoring.",
    "Governance dashboards offering release readiness, quality risk assessments, and project health summaries.",
    "Configurable quality gates and manual/automatic release approval workflows.",
    "Comprehensive audit logging for all CRUD operations and governance actions.",
    "Automated report generation in multiple formats (PDF, Excel, CSV) with asynchronous processing and polling support.",
    "n8n workflow integration for business logic, notifications, and complex operations.",
    "Open API with JWT-based authentication for secure access.",
    "Deployment support via Docker Compose for local development and Hostinger VPS production environments."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "QA Lead logs into the system and views the dashboard with real-time project and task metrics.",
    "QA Lead creates or updates projects and tasks via the frontend or API, with validation and audit logging occurring in the backend and n8n workflows.",
    "QA Lead monitors resource allocation to prevent overallocation, receiving warnings on task creation or updates when limits are approached or exceeded.",
    "QA Lead configures or reviews quality gates on projects to ensure minimum quality thresholds are met before releases.",
    "QA Lead approves or blocks releases based on quality gate evaluations, with compulsory comments and audit trails recorded.",
    "Automated workflows generate detailed reports on project status and quality, which QA Leads and stakeholders can download or receive via email.",
    "System sends notifications and alerts (email, Slack) for overdue tasks, resource overallocations, and critical project statuses.",
    "Admins deploy and maintain the system using provided Docker Compose files and Hostinger VPS deployment instructions, ensuring secure and scalable production use."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "API endpoints must enforce JWT authentication and validate all inputs with structured schemas.",
    "Project and task creation/update must enforce format and status transition rules, rejecting invalid data with clear error messages.",
    "Audit logs must capture complete before and after states for all CRUD and governance actions.",
    "Dashboard metrics must load within 3 seconds under typical loads and reflect accurate aggregated data from database views.",
    "Quality gates must correctly evaluate pass/fail based on configured thresholds and trigger appropriate approval workflows.",
    "Resource utilization warnings must trigger when allocation exceeds 80% capacity and prevent task creation above 100% without override.",
    "Report generation endpoints must accept requests, generate reports asynchronously, and allow clients to poll for completion and download URLs.",
    "Automated workflows must run successfully on schedule with appropriate error handling and notifications.",
    "Deployment guides must enable reproducible local and production deployments using Docker and Hostinger VPS tools."
